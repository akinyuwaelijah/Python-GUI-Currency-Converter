# Python-GUI-Currency-Converter
A beginner-friendly currency converter application built using Python, Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), and the currency-converter library for exchange rate data.

This project allows users to input an amount, specify their current currency, and the desired currency for conversion. Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the application displays the converted amount. It's a great example of how to create a simple yet functional desktop application in Python, demonstrating basic GUI programming concepts and the use of external libraries.
